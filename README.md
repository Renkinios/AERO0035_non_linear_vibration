## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to identify and simulate the nonlinear vibrations of a 2-degree-of-freedom system. The identification process involves three key steps: detection, characterization, and parameter estimation. The simulation is conducted using Nonlinear Frequency Responses (NLFRs) and Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs). Comprehensive details are provided in the accompanying report.

## Requirements
This project requires the installation of the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these dependencies, ensure that [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are installed, then execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
This script enables simulations and identifications. By default, all tasks can be executed, or specific tasks can be selected using command-line arguments. It is **important** to note that the data is too large to include here and must be added manually. To run the project with default settings, use the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
The code will generate the figures and the results of the project. The figures will be saved in the `figures` folder. The user can also change the parameters of the system in the `main.py` file.

To run specific parts of the project, the following commands can be used:
- Identification :

```bash
python src/main.py --identification
```
- Simulation :

```bash
python src/main.py --simulation
```
For help on the command-line arguments, use the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py -h
```


## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the data used in the project, which must be imported manually. Each test is categorized into different folders: `first_lab`, `second_lab`, `third_lab`, and `fourth_lab`.

- **`figures/`**: Stores the figures related to the project. Subfolders `identification` and `simulation` contain figures corresponding to their respective sections.  

- **`src/`**: Includes the project's source code, organized into two main parts: `identification` and `simulation`. Several key files are present:
  - **`VizTool.py`**: Used for generating all graphical representations.  
  - **`DataPull.py`**: Handles data extraction.  
  - **`main.py`**: Compiles and executes the project.  


## AI

The AI is used to occasionally correct the code and to reformulate sentences from the report.
